# City Traffic Intelligence System — Architecture & Feature Guide

## 1. How Does Data Enter Without Physical CCTV Cameras?

In a live smart city deployment, physical CCTV cameras run Edge AI (YOLO detection + PaddleOCR) to read license plates and push events into the ingestion pipeline.

In development, testing, and evaluation, we simulate this using a **Real-Time ANPR Producer** (`mock_anpr_producer.py` or `redis_producer.py`). 

### The Complete Event Pipeline:

                                     [ FRONTEND DASHBOARD ]
```

When you run `python mock_anpr_producer.py`, it generates continuous vehicle sightings across cameras (e.g. `CAM001`, `CAM002`, `CAM003`) along real Chennai highway routes. Once Member 1 connects the real YOLO/PaddleOCR camera feed, it simply pushes the same JSON format to the Redis `anpr_events` stream—zero code changes required in the rest of the backend or frontend!

## 2. Detailed Feature Breakdown & Frontend Location

---

### Feature 1: Live Interactive GIS Map & Camera Network
* **What It Does**:
  Provides a real-time visual command center map displaying all CCTV camera nodes across Chennai, active road corridors, and live health statuses.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - `GET /cameras`: Fetches GPS coordinates and names for all cameras.
  - `GET /cameras/health`: Calculates minutes since last sighting for each camera and determines health status:
    - **HEALTHY** (< 15 min since last vehicle)
    - **WARNING** (15 – 60 min)
    - **OFFLINE** (> 60 min)
  - `GET /camera-routes`: Queries PostGIS `MultiLineString` geometries generated from OpenStreetMap road networks.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **Tab**: `Live Map`
  - **Map Canvas**: High-contrast, dark-mode MapLibre GL map centered on Chennai.
  - **Camera Pins**: Colored circular markers on exact GPS coordinates:
    - 🟢 Green = Healthy
    - 🟡 Yellow/Orange = Warning
    - 🔴 Red = Offline
    - Clicking any pin displays a popup with camera ID, name, configured status, and health.
  - **Corridor Lines**: Glowing blue lines connecting camera nodes along major roads (Anna Salai, Guindy, OMR, etc.).
  - **Top KPI Cards**: 3 cards showing **Total Cameras**, **Healthy Cameras**, and **Offline Cameras**.
  - **Side Network Card**: Lists healthy, warning, and offline camera breakdowns.

---

### Feature 2: Real-Time Vehicle Trajectory Tracking
* **What It Does**:
  As vehicles pass consecutive CCTV cameras, the system links sequential sightings into multi-camera journeys (trajectories) with measured travel times and distances.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - `redis_consumer.py` matches vehicle sightings by license plate within realistic time windows ($t_{start} \to t_{end}$).
  - Inserts completed hops into `trajectories` table.
  - PostgreSQL trigger `trigger_trajectory_created` fires `pg_notify('trajectory_created')`.
  - `trajectory_event_publisher.py` pushes to Redis `trajectory_events`.
  - `app/realtime.py` pushes JSON over `/ws/traffic` WebSocket to browser clients.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **Tab**: `Live Map` (Floating Card) & `Vehicles`
  - **Live Movement Card** (Bottom-right of `Live Map`):
    - Displays: `Latest movement`
    - Large Vehicle ID: e.g. `TN09BV1907`
    - Route hop: `CAM001 → CAM002`
    - Subtitle: `Listening for ANPR events…`
  - **`Vehicles` Tab**:
    - Master table of all vehicles seen across Chennai.
    - Columns: Plate Number, Vehicle Type, Route, Speed, Last Seen timestamp, and Status badge (`Authorized`, `Flagged`, `Suspicious`).

---

### Feature 3: Route Travel-Time Anomaly Detection
* **What It Does**:
  Detects vehicles taking abnormal detours, experiencing unexpected delays/breakdowns, speeding, or skipping intermediate mandatory camera checkpoints.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - `route_anomaly_worker.py`: Compares each vehicle's `travel_time_seconds` against baseline statistics (`route_travel_stats`).
  - Statistical threshold: Flags if travel time deviates beyond $Mean \pm 2\sigma$.
  - Inserts alert into PostgreSQL `alerts` table (`ROUTE_ANOMALY`).
  - PostgreSQL trigger `trigger_alert_created` fires and broadcasts `ALERT_CREATED` over WebSockets.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **Sidebar Navigation Badge**: The `Alerts` tab button displays a red badge with the real-time active count (e.g. `Alerts [14]`).
  - **`Alerts` Tab**:
    - Color-coded incident cards (Red = Critical, Orange = High, Yellow = Medium).
    - Shows: Alert Type (`ROUTE_ANOMALY`), Severity, Cause message, Vehicle ID, Camera ID, and timestamp.
  - **`Live Map` Tab**: An alert ticker badge appears directly inside the live movement box:
    - `🚨 LIVE ALERT: ROUTE_ANOMALY (CAM002)`

---

### Feature 4: Camera Health & Heartbeat Monitor
* **What It Does**:
  Audits the CCTV network every 60 seconds. If a camera stops detecting vehicles (due to hardware failure, network disconnection, or camera occlusion), it alerts operators immediately.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - `camera_health_worker.py`: Runs every 60s, querying `MAX(observed_at)` for each camera.
  - If delta > 60 min, changes status to `OFFLINE` and creates a `CAMERA_HEALTH` alert.
  - Publishes `CAMERA_HEALTH_UPDATED` event to Redis stream `camera_health_events`.
  - Broadcasts via WebSocket to frontend.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **`Live Map` Tab**:
    - The camera pin on the map switches from Green to Orange or Red dynamically without page reload.
    - Top KPI cards update ("Healthy Cameras" count decreases, "Offline Cameras" increases).
  - **`Alerts` Tab**:
    - Creates an incident card: `CAMERA_HEALTH | WARNING: No events received from CAM003 for 64 minutes`.

---

### Feature 5: Collective Movement & Convoy Detection
* **What It Does**:
  Detects unusual surges or coordinated convoys (groups of $\ge 3$ vehicles traveling together within a tight time window across consecutive cameras).
* **Backend Processing**:
  - `collective_movement_engine.py`: Scans 15-minute windows for multi-vehicle clusters.
  - Flags clusters representing $\ge 70\%$ of current traffic but $< 30\%$ historically.
  - Inserts `COLLECTIVE_MOVEMENT` alert into `alerts` table.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **`Alerts` Tab**:
    - Incident card displaying `COLLECTIVE_MOVEMENT`, specifying convoy vehicle count, corridor, and timestamp.

---

### Feature 6: Historical Congestion & Delay Trends
* **What It Does**:
  Aggregates traffic patterns across 15-minute time windows to calculate average delays, travel time index (TTI), and congestion severity.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - `congestion_engine.py` / `analytics_worker.py`: Computes historical baseline vs. current window speeds.
  - Computes `average_delay_seconds` and `congestion_level` (`LOW`, `MODERATE`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`).
  - Stored in `historical_congestion` table.
  - `GET /analytics/congestion/history`: Queried by frontend.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **Tab**: `Analytics`
  - **Traffic Flow Chart** (Top-Left): Interactive SVG polyline chart showing total vehicle count per 15-minute window.
  - **Congestion Trend Chart** (Bottom-Right): Trend graph showing average delay percentage over time to identify bottleneck hours.

---

### Feature 7: Monitored Zone Density Analytics
* **What It Does**:
  Tracks vehicle volumes across city sectors (e.g., Central Business District, Anna Salai Zone, Guindy Industrial Corridor) using PostGIS spatial boundaries.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - Spatial containment query: `ST_Contains(zone.boundary, camera.geom)`.
  - `GET /analytics/traffic/zones`: Groups event counts by zone ID.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **Tab**: `Analytics`
  - **Vehicle Density Chart** (Bottom-Left): Compares vehicle distribution across zones (`Z1`, `Z2`, etc.) so authorities know which sectors are overburdened.

---

### Feature 8: Origin-Destination (OD) Commuter Matrix
* **What It Does**:
  Tracks complete commuter trips from city entry cameras to exit cameras to analyze macro traffic flows.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - `od_engine.py`: Reconstructs trips from continuous vehicle trajectories.
  - `GET /analytics/od-matrix`: Aggregates trip counts per `(origin_camera, destination_camera)` pair.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **Tab**: `Analytics`
  - Feeds traffic volume matrix cards showing primary transit corridors across Chennai.

---

### Feature 9: Traffic Authority Alert Assignment
* **What It Does**:
  Automatically routes incidents to the relevant local traffic police division based on GIS zone boundaries.
* **Backend Processing**:
  - Joins `alerts` with `zones.authority_name` (e.g. "Anna Salai Traffic Wing", "Guindy Division").
  - `GET /analytics/alerts/authorities`: Returns alert load per police department.
* **Where It Is Displayed on Frontend**:
  - **`Alerts` Tab**: Inside each alert card, the location tag displays the assigned division (e.g., `⌖ Guindy Division`).
